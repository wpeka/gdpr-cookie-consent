== Description ==

Looking to comply with the GDPR Cookie Policy?

GDPR Cookie Consent helps you comply in the following ways:

- Provides an easy-to-use admin area in the WordPress dashboard, where you can add details of cookies used on your website. You can also classify cookies into 'Necessary', 'Marketing', 'Analytics', 'Preferences', and the 'Unclassified' categories.

- Shows a cookie consent notice bar on the website. The cookie notice bar shows 'Accept' & 'Decline' buttons. Clicking on the 'Select Cookies' link, opens a detailed view, where a website visitor can see the cookies used on your website. The design of the cookie bar can be customised from the admin area.

- Users can choose to 'Accept' or 'Decline' the use of cookies. They can also choose to consent to use of cookies from a specific category i.e 'Necessary', 'Marketing', 'Analytics', 'Preferences', and the 'Unclassified'.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the `gdpr-cookie-consent` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to "GDPR Cookie Consent" to configure the cookie notice bar with your own text, colours and styles

NOTE: Installing this plugin does not alone make your website GDPR compliant. Every website has different cookie needs and needs to be configured accordingly.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will my website become GDPR compliant after installing the plugin?
Cookie consent is just one aspect of GDPR. Installing the plugin does not guarantee compliance. You’ll still need to implement other aspects of the GDPR regulation.

= Will I have to add all the cookies manually?
Yes, in the free version. The pro version of the GDPR Cookie Consent plugin has a one-click scanner, that’ll scan your website. It’ll also pre-populate cookie information for known cookies.

= Do visitors now have to accept/reject cookies in order to use websites?
No. Only the ‘necessary’ cookies will be loaded until the user gives consent.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the `gdpr-cookie-consent` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Go to "GDPR Cookie Consent" to configure the cookie notice bar with your own text, colours and styles

NOTE: Installing this plugin does not alone make your website GDPR compliant. Every website has different cookie needs and needs to be configured accordingly.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will my website become GDPR compliant after installing the plugin?
Cookie consent is just one aspect of GDPR. Installing the plugin does not guarantee compliance. You’ll still need to implement other aspects of the GDPR regulation.

= Will I have to add all the cookies manually?
Yes, in the free version. The pro version of the GDPR Cookie Consent plugin has a one-click scanner, that’ll scan your website. It’ll also pre-populate cookie information for known cookies.

= Do visitors now have to accept/reject cookies in order to use websites?
No. Only the ‘necessary’ cookies will be loaded until the user gives consent.

2. Cookie consent notice with website's cookie details.
3. General cookie notice options.
4. Customise cookie consent notice design.
